The Audio Recording Toolbox consists of portable equipment, configured to support real-time
GDPR-compliant sound analysis to ensure privacy in urban areas. The AudioMoth microphone is
the input sensor used to capture the soundscape.

The collected sound is analysed to detect human voices/speech and then processed to subtract
the human voice signal. Consequently, the human voice signal is filtered appropriately to blur the
signal, rendering the identity of the speaker/speakers or the content of the speech
incomprehensible.
