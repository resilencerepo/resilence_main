# ReSilent App â€“ Installation & Usage Guide (Android)

The **ReSilent** app captures the outside soundscape through your smartphoneâ€™s microphone and adds layered effects to lower the salience of external sounds. These effects are played through headphones, helping you explore new, soft boundaries between yourself and the world.

## 5. Set Sensitivity and Volume

- ReSilent starts muted:  
  - **Left slider** = sensitivity  
  - **Right slider** = output volume
- Adjust sliders based on your environment:
  - In **noisy places**, high sensitivity may produce constant sounds.
  - In **quiet places**, low sensitivity might only respond to nearby sounds.

ðŸŽ¯ Try to find a setting that allows for **dynamics and silence**â€”this becomes an act of rediscovering your soundscape.

Use both the appâ€™s volume control and your smartphone's system volume as needed.

ðŸŽµ **Example sound files** in the same folder:

- `s_01.wav`, `s_01a.wav`  
- `s_02.wav`, `s_02a.wav`  
- `s_03.wav`, `s_03a.wav`

ðŸ§  You can open `ReSilent.maxpat` in **MaxMSP** to explore and test how the patch processes these sounds.
