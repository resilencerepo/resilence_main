## 5. Set Sensitivity and Volume

- ReSilent starts muted:  
  - **Left slider** = sensitivity  
  - **Right slider** = output volume
- Adjust sliders based on your environment:
  - In **noisy places**, high sensitivity may produce constant sounds.
  - In **quiet places**, low sensitivity might only respond to nearby sounds.

ðŸŽ¯ Try to find a setting that allows for **dynamics and silence**â€”this becomes an act of rediscovering your soundscape.

Use both the appâ€™s volume control and your smartphone's system volume as needed.
