The ReSilent app allows to apply in real-time a subset of the sound design techniques used to lower intrusiveness in the sounds used for the scientific experiment.

The app is intended to be activated when the user finds intrusive a certain soundscape (ex. people talking loudly on a train trip).
Once the app has been launched, it starts transforming the sounds captured by the smartphone's microphone.
